Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

It can be dangerous if a chatbot trained on actual human data interacts with humans without it being known.
The emotional impact from something offensive said can be mitigated if it is clear a robot is being talked to
engineers can try de-humanizing these chatbots, which may seem counter-intuitive but as
long as the bot communicates what it needs to, it does not matter whether it sounds robotic.
And in fact I think we should keep them sounding as robotic as possible when necessary
so users don't get attached to a machine and get offended when a catastrophic mistake is made
by that machine.
